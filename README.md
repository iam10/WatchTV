# ChatTV
This was a project I had hoped would offer people a way of communicating with each other online about tv-shows, movies, news or sports that were airing on several channels. I used the ROVI API to gather data about what programs were airing, their category, the time it started and how long it was. I created a subreddit to post this information. The idea was that people could learn what programs were on and then chat about with other people on reddit.
